## Credit Card Fraud Detection Exploration

This Jupyter Notebook explores a credit card transaction dataset to understand patterns and characteristics that might aid in fraud detection. The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It comprises over 284,000 transactions, with a small fraction (0.172%) being fraudulent.

**1. Data Exploration**

* **Temporal Analysis:** 
    - Non-fraudulent transactions exhibit consistent patterns over time, suggesting regular activity.
    - Fraudulent transactions show more variability, with potential clustering or sporadic occurrences. 
    - Overlap in patterns suggests that time alone may not be a strong indicator of fraud.

* **Transaction Amount Analysis:**
    - Non-fraudulent transactions display clear daily cycles with regular peaks and troughs, indicating predictable spending habits.
    - Fraudulent transactions exhibit less structure with lower and less consistent peaks, suggesting irregular or smaller amounts. 
    - Minimum transaction amounts are consistently low for non-fraudulent transactions, while they show more variability for fraudulent transactions.

* **Distribution of Transaction Amounts:**
    - Box plots reveal the distribution of transaction amounts for both fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases. 
    - Overlapping distributions suggest that transaction amount alone may not be sufficient to reliably distinguish between the two classes.
    - Outliers, particularly for fraudulent transactions, might indicate unusual or suspicious activities.

**2. Data Exploration and Model Evaluation**

* **Data Unbalancing:** The dataset exhibited a significant class imbalance, with fraudulent transactions constituting a small minority. Techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling were applied to address this imbalance.
* **Feature Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots were used to visualize the distributions of key features and identify potential outliers. 
* **Feature Relationships:** Correlation matrices and pair plots were generated to explore relationships between features and identify potential multicollinearity.

* **Data Split:** The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to prevent overfitting and ensure unbiased model evaluation.
* **Model Development:** Several models were trained and evaluated:
    * **Logistic Regression:** Achieved an AUC score of 0.98 on the test set.
    * **Decision Tree Classifier:** Achieved an AUC score of 0.83 on the test set.
    * **Random Forest Classifier:** Achieved an AUC score of 0.92 on the test set.
    * **Naive Bayes Classifier:** Achieved an AUC score of 0.96 on the test set.
    * **XGBoost:** 
        * Hyperparameters were tuned using grid search or other optimization techniques on the validation set.
        * Achieved a best validation score of 0.984 and a test set AUC of 0.974.
    * **LightGBM:** 
        * Evaluated using both train-validation split and cross-validation.
        * Achieved a validation set AUC of ~0.974 and a test set AUC of 0.946 using train-validation split.
        * Achieved a test set AUC of 0.97 using cross-validation.

**3. Model Selection**

Based on the evaluation results, the **XGBoost** and **Naive Bayes** models demonstrated strong performance with high AUC scores on the test set. The final model selection will be based on a comprehensive evaluation considering factors such as:

* **Model Accuracy:** AUC score, precision, recall, F1-score.
* **Interpretability:** Ease of understanding and explaining the model's predictions.
* **Computational Cost:** Training and prediction time.
* **Business Requirements:** Specific needs and constraints of the fraud detection system.

**4. Further Considerations**

* **Feature Engineering:** Exploring and implementing feature engineering techniques (e.g., creating new features based on existing ones) may further improve model performance.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Considering ensemble methods like stacking or boosting to combine the strengths of multiple models.
* **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Continuous monitoring of model performance and retraining as needed to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

**5. Conclusions**

This exploration provides insights into the characteristics of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. While some patterns emerge, the challenge lies in the overlap between the two classes. Further investigation into additional features and potentially machine learning techniques might be necessary to develop a more robust fraud detection system.
